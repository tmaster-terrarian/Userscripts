# Userscripts
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless otherwise specified, these scripts have only been tested with Tampermonkey. I don't know if some of them will work with other Userscript managers/injectors.

A collection of Userscripts that I've created. Mostly small features or tweaks. This repository is a work in progress at the moment.
<br>Each script can be found in its respective folder.

If a problem comes up with one of my scripts from here, submit an Issue on this repository. I will try to resolve any reported issues but don't worry if I don't respond immediately.
